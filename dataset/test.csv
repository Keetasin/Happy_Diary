"""Indefinitely grounded"" according to my father. How do I proceed with this situation?   ---   **tl;dr**: Parents basically fucking hate me and have called me all sorts of terrible things because I was arrested for small weed possession, and are threatening to demolish my social life. What do I do to improve the situation?",minimum
"Hello r/assistance. My name is Cameron and recently I was denied my social security payments on the ground of my mental disability improving enough to be considered able to work. My doctor disagrees with their assessment and local social workers are helping me with my appeal. Unfortunately, due to the social security office filing my appeal paperwork slowly, I passed the deadline to where I could continue to receive payment while under appeal. If anyone would be willing to contribute to my bills while I am under appeal, it would be greatly appreciated.",minimum
"There's a TL;DR at the bottom for those who wanna get to the point this gets kinda lengthy. Hi, I'm 19 and this is my first time posting here and I'm hoping at least one person can relate. Before a few months ago I never had to deal with anxiety really, but out of nowhere it hit me like a truck. I guess what's been causing it is relationship issues, but mostly health anxiety. My first major mistake was googling symptoms I started having, not realizing that it was normal for anxiety to cause physical symptoms.",minimum
"I've been trying to remain hopeful that these symptoms won't really start improving until 6-8 weeks like the first time I took it to relieve depression. It doesn't help that after looking up SSRI withdrawal online, I've read reinstating might not work the longer I'm off it and it's recommended to take a very low dose in order to alleviate symptoms. This is leaving me worried since I've stopped for a month and took a higher dosage than I last left off. It doesn't say what happens if I happen to take a high dosage, so I'm worried I'm making things worse by continuing with this high dosage and I have no idea what to do right now. I feel very messed up and I'm scared these withdrawal symptoms will never go away or may become permanent.",severe
"I apologised and thought that was the end of it. It’s gotten to the point that if I walk into a room, she’ll leave straight away, and if she doesn’t leave, or if I start talking to her or someone else, she sighs a lot so I know my presence is not wanted. If I’m in her general direction of travel, she’ll be sure to make a wide berth around me, and the only time she’s spoken a full sentence to me was to say “thanks for my present” that I got her for Christmas. Then we get to tonight. Eva and one of my brothers are staying over at our cousins house.",minimum
"Hi everyone, this is my story, what I've been able to take away from it, and the feelings and the hurt that have lingered, as well as questions. Warning, this is kind of a long post, but there is a lot I need to say and just get out of my head. Trigger and Content Warnings**:** Explicit mentions of sex acts with some details,mentions of coercion, mentions of being threatened, mentions of alcoholism. Things to know about me, for the context of my life and who I am: I am 24, I am queer, my pronouns are she/her, I am trans-gender woman (please Google if you are unfamiliar with the terms), I am autistic, and as a child I was home-schooled for a very long time and lived in the middle of nowhere farm country, with no buses, sidewalks, or means of transportation. When I was 13, I had just found out my father was diagnosed with early onset dementia and I was stricken, to say the least, knowing that my already dysfunctional family was about to go through the horrors of watching my father become less and less of himself.",minimum
"I wanted to plant a new chapter in my new city, but haven't had time to devote to making it happen yet. I feel like I was the only one taking it seriously and it's dying a slow death. My problem is that one of the acquaintances is giving me a lot of power play-type problems. For example, I'll request *four times* in three different mediums we use, to email contributions to an end-of-year favorites list and rather than do that, she put hers on a share drive and told others to do the same in spite of my multiple requests to email me instead for better ease of sharing. Emails are met with snarky responses or half-measures which mean I still have to chase down.",minimum
"So I met this girl last year, in November. Although we only dated officially for around a month, the feelings became very intense. Around the week before Christmas, she confessed she had been cheating on me with someone. At the time she was very distant towards me, and of course the cheating explained that. She and I met up last week to talk, I thought I would get closure but all I felt afterwards was a deep sense of regret.",minimum
"My mother is a narcissist. A few months ago I pulled up my credit report and discovered that my mother had stolen my identity in 2015– but had just paid off the balance. I asked her about it and she admitted it without apologizing. A few weeks ago I was thinking about what I owe in student loans, and it wasn’t adding up. I asked her if she ever pulled out extra money for herself, and she snapped.",minimum
"I don't mind the fact that she goes, I don't even mind if she goes at the same time as me. I just wish she wouldn't make such a big deal out of doing it together. How do I convey this to her without looking like a selfish asshole? **Tl;dr: I prefer to work out by myself for various reasons. My roommate decided to start going with me and is requesting that I make accommodations to my schedule and routine so that she can join me.",minimum
"She said she always had to message first, and she decided to completely blank me when I apologised, and that was that. The first girl to ever express proper interest in me in my life ends up going completely down the drain. I don't know if it was because of my own management of messages or me being unattractive in general, but despite this great date occurring I only feel absolutely awful because of it in the end. Oh, and to rub salt into the wounds I even noticed she unliked my profile picture of all things. Ouch.",minimum
"But I noticed recently, that my sleeping problems might have a reason.

"I don't ""feel"" in this anymore, but I honestly can't tell if I just can't let bygones be bygones or if I'm looking at this objectively. If I do break it off, it's going to crush her personally AND add the awkwardness of her telling her friends and family its off. So I don't want to do it unless it's you know, really what's needed. And if I do leave, how do I mitigate someone who has threatened suicide at the action of me leaving? **edit**: Thanks everyone.",minimum

Three years ago I used to be on a medicine that helped with the nightmares, I can’t remember the name though.

While at school one day, my mom collected some of my belongings and put them in a bag by the door, and then confiscated my house key, telling me I had to leave by the next morning.

"I've got a good handle on my triggers. I know how to prepare myself when I have to encounter a trigger and how to move past it without too much discomfort. That being said today I encountered an event that blindsided me. I was not prepared at all.

Now my treatment has stopped this triggering from happening and sometimes think about moving back. If I do I will occasionally see places and buildings connected to bad memories. When visiting my town now I am OK seeing those places but I don't like it so I avoid them. My choices are moving back or sell and start a new life elsewhere. So I ask if anyone else have done a similar move back to your hometown and managed well?,minimum
"Wanted to celebrate with my friends, but I know the story would worry them more than anything else, and I'm really excited. I punched a guy for trying to not use a condom! I was sexually abused as a teen, and since then advocating for myself -especially in sexual situations- is really difficult for me. But today I had a guy come over and, when he tried getting off without using a condom **even though he agreed to use one not five minutes before,** I punched him several times off my bed and then a few times more while he was standing up (he's almost double my weight). I yelled at him for a bit and he shoved me down before he left, but within a minute of me reacting he was already putting on his shorts and on his way out.",minimum
"I laid there terrified not knowing what was going to happen. Not knowing when, or if, it was going to stop I was fighting back tears because I knew I had to keep trying to out smart him in order to protect myself and make Erik stop attacking me.

"Two years ago we moved to a different city for his work. He earns a lot more than me and his job offers a lot more career progression, so I wanted to support him. I’ve always thought we were a good team, there have been times where he’s struggled financially and I’ve helped him out no question. We talked about the extra money he’d be able to save by walking to work (2 mins away,) and it seemed as though we were on the same page for what we wanted in the future; buy our own place, a car and start a family. So I thought all was on the right track.",minimum

Clearly I need to move out, but the only person I have in my life is my boyfriend, and although we see each other often, we've been long-distance for awhile and it would be a huge adjustment to move almost 100 miles away (although it would be far enough away from them.) Although I love him a lot, I don't exactly want the reason that I move in because he's trying to save me. I want to move in because I want to start a new life with him, not to run away from the old if that makes sense. So, I guess my question is, what do I do?",minimum

"Long story but a few years ago my wife of fifteen years, who had never been with anyone else opened up and told me she fantasized a lot about being with other men, and considered herself somewhat polyamorous. I was upset and it took a couple of years of us discussing this before I started to feel more comfortable with things. We eventually started swinging (only about once every couple of months and always same room) as it seemed like a way for us to explore this part of her together, and it ended up being a lot of fun and something I really enjoyed that brought us closer together. Well, it’s been a couple of years and I’ve felt happy and comfortable with where we are at but  I decided to ask my wife the other day and she said she was happy but she also had a desire to date people separately, and would be willing to try it if I was.

"2. Socialize! we sure did not evolve as lone creatures, we always evolved as packs, it was always crucial to our survival, and thats why we get anxious without it, even if we dont know it, but that doesn't mean you need to 24/7 socialize, Remember - lonliness is a nice place to visit, but a horrible place to live in, so go out there and simply talk to other people, it  can be your school mates, colleagues, or even something a lot more simple such as your local shop clerk, in the last few years we can see a sharp decline in socializing because mainly everything became online, and our survival instincts kick in, letting us know something is way off, and needs to be fixed, it does not like being alone, and do not try to replace real human socializing with social networks, which brings me to the next point - &#x200B; 3.",minimum

"Hello, You are invited to complete a survey for a WMU psychology department research project designed to assess treatment preferences among adults seeking treatment for a variety of concerns. We hope to learn if and how preferences for treatment change over time, and if patient’s perception of their treatment’s match to their preferences is related to the benefit received from treatment. The survey is open to anyone ages 18 or older who is currently engaged in mental health treatment for at least one month and four therapy sessions, and not longer than one year. If you choose to participate, you will be asked to provide some demographic/background information, respond to survey items about your preferences for treatment and how they have changed over time, and about your quality of life.

"I'd never heard this idea until recently, and I'm starting to see it cropping up more, always in opposition to any kind of support (or even empathy) for the homeless - any attempt to help the homeless is pointless because 'most' homeless people want to be homeless; therefore housing programs/assistance, mental health & substance abuse support are wasted because the homeless are too lazy to get themselves out of homelessness and 'enjoy' their condition, because they don't have to work, because they don't have to pay bills, because they don't have responsibilities, because they're lazy etc. I strenuously disagree with this, and I feel like it's an attempt to move the goalposts; there's a growing awareness that homeless people may not necessarily be homeless because they got themselves into that position and they 'deserve' it, but because of substance abuse issues and mental health problems, coupled with a breakdown in social network. But that's a lie, or 'lefty propaganda', for some people; they want to believe, despite whatever legitimate reasons some homeless may have for not being in shelters, say, that it's a *moral failing* \- going full circle, they don't deserve help because their homelessness is a consequence of decisions they made.

Another little thing I'd like to add is that that I seriously struggle seeing my own self worth and how much I mean to my friends and family (who are all amazing by the way I love them all so much). Eventually on fairly rare occasions those thoughts tend to lead to depression, paranoia that people around me hate me and don't want anything to do with me, dissociation with reality and then finally the rock bottom of that would be thoughts of suicide (though I've never acted out on these thoughts or would ever want to) and the occasional anxiety attack where I feel nauseous, my heart beats really fast, my limbs feel like jelly, heavy breathing, I feel panicked and I just want to get out of the situation as quickly as possible.

"Even present-day situations where they are receiving love from a safe person can trigger the awareness and subsequent grief of knowing how unloved they were by comparison. Anxiety and depression are considered commonplace, but I suspect many of those who consider themselves anxious or depressed are actually experiencing the fallout of trauma. Most therapists are not well trained to handle trauma, especially the complex kind that stems from prolonged exposure to abuse. Unless they are specially certified, they might have had a few hours in graduate school on Cluster B personality disorders, and even fewer hours on helping their survivors. Many survivors of complex trauma are often misdiagnosed as having borderline personality disorder (BPD) or bipolar disorder.",minimum

At this point I royally freaked out and he said the reason he made up the story about driving to the airport was because now that it looked like he committed to attending, it'd be easier to  come up with some urgent non negotiable reason why he couldn't make it (rather than look like a jerk that ditched last minute for something else that popped up without giving any notice). Again understandable. I do buy the story because when the girl called, she told me nothing was going on beyond friendship and that they hadn't talked in forever, she said she herself was busy with a new relationship which why is they hadn't talked beyond simple texts here and there, which would explain why she didn't know he was dating me just until that moment.",minimum
