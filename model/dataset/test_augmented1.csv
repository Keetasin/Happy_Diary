Obviously this doesn’t help the mental health. I have a great relationship with a professor at my institution. Because I go to a SLAC close professor / student relationships are encouraged. My professor has been very helpful and making sure I get the mental health assistance needed while at school while also frequently checking in on me. This person has also offered to Skype me over break if I needed to chat or if being home became difficult.,minimum
"I refused to carry both of us anymore and I was also bored between us. So part of me hoped that he would not pay the rent and that would make me push me to move forward. However, I was okay with the shelter. But I'm worried about my laptop I remember when I lived in a shelter when I was a child. They didn't allow you to have some items. I don't want to separate the laptops for them to be safe and ""disappear"".",moderate

"I live alone, make sure my dog gets the exercise he needs, I keep my apartment tidy, I do my laundry, I make sure I’m eating good, I work out, and I still hang with friends and such. Really, the only time I play video games is after work (which is normally after 8:30pm) or when I’m off. Even when I’m off, I still do chores and such between playing games. Even though I’m good at getting this stuff done, I still feel like there’s this weight on my shoulders that I should do MORE. Even when I cut video games out of the equation (which I did for the last week and a half) I still don’t do MORE because I’m normally too tired to do anything else.",moderate

Someone I know has been compulsively chattering their teeth. They told me it started because they could feel their teeth wobble a little when they clenched their teeth together while feeling them with their finger (we all know this is just one of those weird tricks the teeth play on you) but it's become compulsive now. They told me they feel ill from it. They don't have any anxiety issues and the chattering is just a result of the above but I can see how it would become one. What can be done to make this go away?,minimum

She referred me to a dermatologist who was known to treat white gay guys and other asian gay guys with genital warts. That's how gossipy these doctors can be.

I just feel kinda gross because I was giving her fucking college advice and stuff. I'm fucking furious. My clearest memory of my dad in highschool is him ramming my head repeatedly into a wall because I didn't want to pick engineering as a *second choice*. And NOW he chooses to support and help this fucking girl through college when I had to do all that on my own? He even skipped out on my graduation!,moderate

"She never disclosed any of this to me, and probably never would have if the embassy hadn't discovered it first. In her words, she was afraid I would lose all interest in her if I found out she was married before. Truth be told, I likely would have, as I was still young when we first met. She claims she left that husband because of the abuse she received from him and his relatives ((still lived with his parents)). I was crushed at that time, as we had only been married for about a month.",mild

"(TW sexual abuse mentions) When I was 14 I was sexually abused regularly for 8 months, resulting in PTSD, and recently I realised that afterwards I completely changed how I looked. I went from being this pretty normal looking student, short cropped hair, I would wear normal casual clothing on weekends, I was healthy, all that, now, over three years later I look completely different, I'm stick thin, hair grown out past my shoulders, I only wear black and almost always clothes that cover as much of me as possible, heavy scarring covering the majority of my body, and messy facial hair growing in. I feel like I've completely altered myself so nobody is tempted to hurt me again, like I'm blaming how I looked for what happened, so completely changing it seemed like the most sensible thing. I've never heard of anyone else doing this before though, is this normal?",minimum
