"I am alone, and I don't know what to do. At this time I'm most interested in any 'quick tips' that can be offered on how to manage feelings of violation, betrayal, humiliation, distress, anger at the abuser and all those who stood by, ignoring the damage she was inflicting, anger at those who have protected her at the expense of her victims, anger at my family for their mistreatment, and how they effectively set me up for future abuse. Dissociative symptoms are a significant problem at this time. Focusing on a movie, tv show, video game, book, even a short song can be impossible at times. The interest in 'quick tips' on how to manage those overwhelming emotions is an attempt to make it feasible to read a fre books I'm hoping might help (Pete walker's CPTSD and James Chu's Rebuilding shattered lives, MacKenzie's Psychopath free).",severe

"Grad school isn’t really the easiest place to parent alone. Assistantships don’t pay you enough to live off of by yourself (Mine nets me a little less than $800 a month, rent is $750), let alone with a tiny human that needs a particular type of education. They also require you commit to 20 hours a week of on campus work. Essentially meaning, you can’t really hold a full time job anywhere. On top of this, working another part time becomes difficult because work hours have to coincide with the hours your little one is at school, and with 20 hours a week on campus already, that leaves little time to actually work anywhere else during school hours.",minimum

Because you may be unbelievably poisonous, so I consider just to block you and ""ghost"" as the main, but I feel that it is very rude and at least she deserves the explanation. How can I break up with you without making you turn me?",severe
"*edited out the father's name* six-year-old son K needs a bone marrow match to help him survive.  K was born on Sept. 18, 2011. When he was first brought home, his parents believed their son was a healthy baby boy. A year into K's life all seemed well, but his health started to fail shortly after his first birthday.  K was diagnosed with Dyskeratosis Congenita, which is also known as Zinsser-Engman-Cole syndrome.",minimum
"Hi there r/Assistance! My dad has a Traumatic Brain Injury from a car accident two years ago. He was the victim of another driver's recklessness and negligence, and was rear-ended twice while stopped at a stoplight. He was forced to retire as he is now permanently disabled and will have to deal with the effects of permanent brain damage for the rest of his life. My dad requires a constant caretaker because he exhibits symptoms similar to that of an alzheimer's or dementia patient, so my mom is unable to work either.",minimum
I don't have friends This is both the cause and effect of my anxiety and depression. I can open and be confident when I know people and I have friends before. But I am almost all year without real friends since I moved. Movement and impact that has a huge impact on my confidence in creating new friends because most of my interaction is with people in a small town with friends and known other groups for many years. Difficult moments in conversations with acquaintances and reducing the gap of relationships.,severe
"I would rather kill myself than hurt other people so why the fuck did that even occur to me? My therapist told me I'm meant to be alive and hugged me and I don't even know why because how could I be meant to be alive if I have thoughts like this? What's the point? It honestly feels like depression or ptsd or whatever this is has stripped me of normal human emotions and humanity and I'm just like this vacuum moving around undetected that people, like my therapist, fail to see is awful and unlovable and unfixable. I don't feel anything in conversations, I have trouble with empathy sometimes.",severe
"She is very sweet and I love her immensely. I can't leave her where I am currently for fear of her being neglected. She is very attached to me. I will have no choice but to live in my car for the foreseeable future, which leaves me with the issue of what to do with her. I can't keep her locked in my car all day.",severe
"She still invites me to things and hasn't started dating anyone else (or even talked about it), but frankly, I'm starting to feel kind of pathetic asking her to hang out after she turned me down for the date. I do like her as a friend, but have started thinking of her as more than that and it's hard for me to ignore that when we spend time together. It's even starting to affect my self-esteem a bit, because usually if someone turns me down (no matter how reasonable the excuse) I just move on to someone else and spend less time with them, but it's a bit harder when that person is already your friend. My questions are: should I just give up on the potential of a romantic future with this person, or is it possible she's still feeling things out (like she says)? And regardless of this, should I start spending less time with her/stop inviting her to things (even if just for my own sake)?",severe
"I am fat, not attractive, no stimulation and the best of all six numbers in student loans and not yet graduated! I will not be able to live myself, so there is a little hope in dating, even though the relationship is not good for me. I fucked in my future. Haha. I have a continuous stomach pain and hard pain everywhere. From all the anxiety that I feel 24/7, my health also decreases, so it's fun.",severe
I am constantly afraid of when it's going to happen next and I'm so scared I'm going to have some embarrassing reaction to it. It happened today and I was able to play it cool for about 5 minutes and then I went on my lunch and cried my eyes out in my car. I've been having really bad flashbacks all afternoon and night. I really wish it didn't get to me like this. My day was seriously ruined by a harmless prank.,mild
"The vehicle then hit a tree and went into the river. He was able to get out the vehicle but the rapids of the river were too strong and he couldn't save his girlfriend and his son. He then had to find a house or someone with a phone to call 911. Once rescue came, they also couldn't save his girlfriend and son due to the water being too high and dangerous. And all occupants passed away in that accident.",minimum
"This past week he's gotten really bad where he told her she couldn't use the house phone, her cell phone, the computer, the car, or even watch tv. He even stopped eating food that my mom makes and starting making his own for himself. Yesterday I atleast bought my mom a new cell phone and added her to my plan. He hasn't improved in the past week whatsoever. This was the last straw for me and I want to move out in the next 2 months and ask her to live with me temporarily.",minimum
"First things first, this may contain triggers for several different types of abuse. If this is no the right place for this post, by all means get rid of it, last thing I want to do is cause trouble for others. I'll refer to my wife as M Some background: My wife's parents immigrated from the Soviet Union in the 80s with her brother, wife was born in the early 90s. Obviously life followed a different set of rules in the USSR, and that's bound to be a difficult thing to adjust to.",minimum
"In some ways, I can handle it more than the average person who hasn't gone though such a trauma. Sometimes it's hard to remember that, though, when you're breaking down over some otherwise harmless feedback. I'm tired of people misunderstanding. I'm tired of feeling weak and broken. I'm just tired.",mild
