"so i finally got tired of being anxious and depressed, crying daily, not leaving the house a few months ago and decided it was time to see a doctor again. I would only leave to work, and couldnt hold a job very long due to the anxiety(eventually stop going after successfully alienating myself from everyone) and went to see a psychiatrist. He started me on 40mg of fluoxetine and 50mg atenolol a day with 1mg lorazepam 3x daily as needed. I averaged about 2 of the lorazepam a day, some days 3 some days 1 or even 0, and 1 time i took 4(christmas with the family, not all at once but over the course of the evening) I went back after about 2 and a half months and he increased my atenolol to 100mg and switched me to .5mg alprazolam 1x a day(from the past i knew this wouldnt be an effective dose but he wouldnt listen) For the 2 and a half months i felt like i was leading a normal life, doing well in school, seeing friends again, working, going on dates(have a girlfriend who understands my anxiety and we met when  i was drinking to deal with it so this is the worst shes ever seen me and wants me to find a new doctor) interacting with my family and not hiding in my room all day. With the switch to xanax ive gone back to my old ways of hiding away, crying, not eating, and have almsot purchased cigarettes again(quit smoking about 10 months ago).",mild

"I got out of an abusive relationship about three years ago. I had awful things happen to me before it, but it really was the absolute rock bottom. The man strangled me unconscious and beat me, and I wound up sleeping with a knife under my pillow, and then sleeping on the streets, constantly checking over my shoulder.

"My problem is, if I'm going to date anyone, they have to be aware that I struggle with PTSD and willing to at least be there for me when I need. I don't need coddling or protecting, I just need someone to hold my hand and let me cry it out, or help me through a flashback. I need someone who can *be* present and emotional, and someone I can feel comfortable having a conversation with about it.

"Unfortunately, it also affects pretty much everything in my life, including working memory and everyday events. It didn't happen daily or even weekly, but I was always afraid that I might say or do something that can trigger it, so I always kept quiet and didn't say much, and I guess that's why my language did not develop properly either. The neuropsychologist I saw offered me books to read to learn more about my condition but did not give any other treatment options because the cause of my disorder was unknown.

He suggested I view this adrenal response as simply “emotional arousal to something something novel.” This conversation caused me to have the revelation that for at least the past 5 years, I haven’t been able to experience anything “exciting” as something other than anxiety inducing.

Because if my mind's left to wander, without something to focus on, something to distract myself, it starts tearing itself apart, ripping open old wounds and rubbing salt in them; reminding me of all the shit I've screwed up in the past, ways I've failed or fallen short, and I end up worse off than when I started. So, I eventually stopped going. And then, eventually stopped taking my meds, mostly because of not having the money to afford them when my father walked out, and the house practically started falling down around our ears over a course of a couple years; the heating just before winter because we couldn't afford oil, then losing water due to burst pipes, then the gas and finally electricity due to nonpayment.",mild

She often told me that as soon as I met my gf, I quit talking to her (Lisa). As my relationship with my gf became more serious, Lisa and I became even more distant from each other, and she would often ignore my texts or emails (neither of us were ever much for talking on the phone).",minimum

"Hello, You are invited to complete a survey for a WMU psychology department research project designed to assess treatment preferences among adults seeking treatment for a variety of concerns. We hope to learn if and how preferences for treatment change over time, and if patient’s perception of their treatment’s match to their preferences is related to the benefit received from treatment. The survey is open to anyone ages 18 or older who is currently engaged in mental health treatment for at least one month and four therapy sessions, and not longer than one year. If you choose to participate, you will be asked to provide some demographic/background information, respond to survey items about your preferences for treatment and how they have changed over time, and about your quality of life.

During my stay outdoors, I currently work and maintain 3 jobs; one that pays me officially and 'on the books', while the other two serve as jobs that pay me on the side and 'off the books'. This isn't an easy affair either as they all require me to travel to different locations around the area by walking or use of public transportation, which is one of the expenses I am forced to cover on my own and my lack of sleep does not help matters regarding my performance as these jobs. Currently, and for the past 5 weeks, I've been staying at the beach nearby my old home as this is the only area where I am not told to leave by any authority figures, such as on-site workers and police patrolling the area, and also the only area I felt remotely safe at.

"I brought it up to him (assuming this forum would tell me to) and he got very livid at me. Now we’re not speaking (His friend is still at his house). Not sure what to do. TL;DR: bfs friend from out of town is staying with him while I was away. Not sure if they are doing normal friend stuff, or if my bf has a crush.",minimum
"How did you come up with it? I've wanted to kill myself almost everyday for 17 years. I'm done talking to therapists and asking friends for help. Right now I see two options: commit suicide or develop an emergency self-care plan for when I'm feeling this way so I'll be okay until I feel safe again. Unfortunately, my meds only impact anxiety (and only sometimes), not depression or PTSD.",severe
"I'm afraid of going into too much detail only because I constantly fear that he knows that I talk about him. To keep it short, my father was physically violent towards me, my mother, our dog, mistreated all of his animals, leaked our information on shady sites before multiple times, and has made my life a living hell up until I went to court to stop having visitation with him. I almost died twice thanks to him. I thought that it wouldn't really affect anything outside of startle reflex, trust issues, etc, but here I am years after my last visit with him and it's still affecting me fucking terribly. I just sat in bed sobbing for a half hour because I'm afraid of everyone around me.",moderate
"She claims that because she is a woman, nobody will believe me. I'm not exactly sure what she did to herself, but when the police came she claimed that I hit her and had a flushed cheek to show for it. Fortunately,  the police were able to put together what actually happened based on my blood trail. Thank God I was sitting when she hit me and that the blood all around me proved it otherwise I would be in jail for something I didn't do. Things have been escalating for a while and this is the second time she has been arrested in the past 3 months for assault.",minimum
"Hi! This is my first time posting on reddit, and I was just looking for some advice. So to give some background... I live in a block of flats (in Coventry), and we have a communal area with a bin shed and our personal sheds. I was taking my rubbish out this morning, with my dog, and he was really interested in my shed, do I opened it for him to sniff (it was broken into earlier in the year, and the lock has been broken since).",minimum
