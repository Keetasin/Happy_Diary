I have a very bad feeling. But at first I didn't care about it The nanny is a man and the person I have never met! I was afraid because I didn't know this man and I didn't understand why her mother thought it was fine for a man who would take care of the two girls. One of them was a child that he had never contacted. Her mother left the house and we were there with this strange and creepy man. I feel uncomfortable all the time.,mild

"Okay so a bit of background, me and my girlfriend are in our second year of college (my subjects make a freshman though hehe) and have been together for 6 months.

Don't get me wrong, I love her to bits and I enjoy talking to her about these things, it's just that I'm slightly worried that maybe she is in love with the idea of me, and I with the idea of her.",minimum

"I'd never heard this idea until recently, and I'm starting to see it cropping up more, always in opposition to any kind of support (or even empathy) for the homeless - any attempt to help the homeless is pointless because 'most' homeless people want to be homeless; therefore housing programs/assistance, mental health & substance abuse support are wasted because the homeless are too lazy to get themselves out of homelessness and 'enjoy' their condition, because they don't have to work, because they don't have to pay bills, because they don't have responsibilities, because they're lazy etc. I strenuously disagree with this, and I feel like it's an attempt to move the goalposts; there's a growing awareness that homeless people may not necessarily be homeless because they got themselves into that position and they 'deserve' it, but because of substance abuse issues and mental health problems, coupled with a breakdown in social network. But that's a lie, or 'lefty propaganda', for some people; they want to believe, despite whatever legitimate reasons some homeless may have for not being in shelters, say, that it's a *moral failing* \- going full circle, they don't deserve help because their homelessness is a consequence of decisions they made.

I am developing a storytelling and mental health platform with the ultimate aim of curating a museum exhibition. Soul relics Museum is a platform for people to read and tell stories of mental health through objects that help them connect or express to a present or past experience they have had with their mental health. It’s a unique and creative idea to help people come forward and share with others what mental health problems have been like for them and a safe and constructive way to read of others experiences while being brave enough to share your own.

"Due to leaving my hairbrush at home during Spring Break, I haven't been able to brush my hair in months. I am also almost out of deodorant, toothpaste, and mouth rinse. My lease for my apartment will be running out on the 31st, meaning I'll be going back home to Houston (where I'll get a different job that actually calls me into work and doesn't leave me with only 8 cents in my account. I wish I was kidding). I'll need to clean the apartment for inspection, so I also need some cleaning supplies.",minimum
I once went to the hospital and needed hand surgery so I messaged her when I found out and said “hey mom I’m in the hospital I’m having surgery tonight thought I would let you know.” She never came to visit and she never even asked what kind of surgery it was. What do I do? I feel like I’m nothing but I burden and I just wanna disappear. I rebelled and did my own thing as a teenager because I was so hurt from what I had been through is it normal for her to hold it against me? She just sees me as the fuck up causing her annoyance.,mild
With my daughter recovering and my wife getting further in her diagnosis and her pregnancy I haven’t been able to catch up and it’s snowballing out of control. We applied for social security for both my wife and daughter but our paperwork was “lost in the system”.     I went to court last week and the writ of possession will be filed tomorrow morning to have my belongings removed from the home. I have asked for loans and co-signers but nobody close to the family is willing to take a hit to their credit. I have sought out rental assistance from local charities but they will only help me if I got the balance down to $500.,minimum
"I feel like I'm starting to get the control back over my life slowly. I'm resignating to my situation and I'm ready to make things better for myself. I have stable relationship with my very supportive wife, my ambitions are growing back slowly... I finnaly have hope and I could hardly ask for more. I asked my doc to lower my Effexor because I feel like the the side-effects outweigh the good it does: It doesn't really help much for my anxiety, I feel depersonalization ever since I'm on medications and finally it gives me uncontrollable cravings.",mild
"I texted him good morning. Then begun the message about how I would love to, but I can't because marriage is something I want now. Before I got the chance to send that text, he sent another one. He had come to the conclusion that he wanted to marry me. Genuinely.",minimum
"Hey everybody. I'm not really sure else where else to possibly post this. I'm currently between jobs and looking to make money in any way I can, so I was wondering if anyone would be interested in buying a cross stitch commission from me. I can do any type of pattern or design, in various sizes. Here are some examples of things I've made: <url>",minimum
"I am also not sure if I should press charges on my mother for stealing my identity, or even bother looking into the student loan fraud. Student loan fraud is incredibly difficult to prove, and reporting identity theft would be a lengthy process. The debt is paid and I almost feel like just running away and forgetting about it. I am 26 and truly terrified because, though I have been on my own before, I have never been completely alone or financially independent. I am shocked and horrified by everything that has happened to me in the last year.",minimum
"Hello everyone, a couple of months now I can't get rid of this. My attack is my cousin who is 5-7 years older than me (24F). He is very close to my brother and father. His father is a great person and my favorite uncle.",moderate
"Hello, You are invited to complete a survey for a WMU psychology department research project designed to assess treatment preferences among adults seeking treatment for a variety of concerns. We hope to learn if and how preferences for treatment change over time, and if patient’s perception of their treatment’s match to their preferences is related to the benefit received from treatment. The survey is open to anyone ages 18 or older who is currently engaged in mental health treatment for at least one month and four therapy sessions, and not longer than one year. If you choose to participate, you will be asked to provide some demographic/background information, respond to survey items about your preferences for treatment and how they have changed over time, and about your quality of life. The survey may take between 30-40 minutes to complete.",minimum
"I don't know how to maintain my relationship with my brother while he still lives under my parents' control \(which covers everything from finances, to communication with other people, to leaving their house \-\- or rather not being outside the house without them other than for school and work\). I'm lucky enough to have a few wonderful friends who supported me in various ways while I've been getting situated, but I don't know how to grow my friendships with them now that I have the freedom to. I got so used to not talking much to them as their other friends would, and I guess they're used to that from me. With new people that I meet, I find it very difficult to relate to their lives. I feel uncomfortable answering questions about myself, my past, and my background.",minimum
"She also said that we may not be sexually compatible and it is not fair to me if I am with you and endure it. Clearly, I told you that I don't want to quit and you can't. I offer your time alone and she is not sure if she doesn't even know if she wants to take me according to the proposal. I said that I think we should wait until the appointment in March to stop your ectropion to see if it helps to improve your lust. We ended up crying and hugging each other.",mild
I told him I’m not using that on my makeup and my contacts stuff! I’m crying and yelling and he is yelling at me and shoving a broom in my face and I just tell him I’m taking all my stuff out of the bathroom so now it’s on the shelves that I just cleared off. So >now the only thing of mine in the bathroom is my toothbrush and tooth paste. &nbsp; >I can’t live like this.I can’t be here anymore.,mild
